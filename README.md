This repository contains all files related to my semester project for IS 3020 - Fall 2019. For my project, I developed a program that allows companies who outsource manufactured goods from overseas to track orders from the time they are placed tot he time of arrival. The Order management team will log into the system and be greeted by a welcome screen containing two options. The first option will be code that allows them to place an order. First they will specify the specific product they wish to order. Second, they will specify the quantity of that product desired. Upon exiting, the code will display the Item:Quantity in the form of a dictionary, with an assosciated order name. After exiting the order system they will be taken back to the welcome screen. If they select the second option, they will be directed to the order tracking screen. This screen will display the orders in order of submission based on time/date. The user will be able to select an order, and the code will display each point during the shipping process, with the anticipated date of arrival for that specific location. The order placement information, as well as the order tacking information will be stored in a SQL database for ease of access.
